Rust Architecture Overview
Rust follows a compile-time architecture and produces native binaries (like C/C++), with powerful safety checks.

🔧 Main Components of Rust Architecture
1. 📝 Source Code (.rs files)
You write code in .rs files using:

Ownership, Borrowing, Lifetimes (for safety)

Macros, traits, modules, and more

2. ⚙️ rustc – Rust Compiler
Rust’s compiler (rustc) is responsible for:

Parsing → Turns source code into Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

Analysis → Checks types, borrow rules, lifetimes, etc.

HIR & MIR → Lowers code into intermediate representations

Code Generation → Sends final IR to LLVM

🔸 Rustc performs static analysis like:

Type inference

Ownership and borrowing checks

Lifetime validation

3. 🧠 LLVM Backend
Rust uses LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) to:

Optimize intermediate representation (IR)

Generate architecture-specific machine code

LLVM is also used by other languages like C, Swift, Julia.

4. 🛠️ Cargo – Build System & Package Manager
While rustc is the compiler, cargo is the default build tool.

Cargo handles:

Project structure

Dependencies (from crates.io)

Building & running

Testing (cargo test), Documentation (cargo doc)

5. 📦 Crates and Modules
Rust code is organized into:

Modules (inside files)

Crates (binary or library packages)

Two kinds:

Binary crate → has a main() and compiles to executable

Library crate → reusable code without main()

6. 🖥️ Final Output: Native Binary
Rust compiles directly to native machine code, meaning:

No virtual machine (like Java/C#)

No interpreter (like Python)

Very fast execution

Minimal runtime overhead

🔒 Memory and Runtime Architecture
Rust doesn’t have a garbage collector (GC).

Instead, it uses:

Feature	Purpose
Ownership	Ensures memory is freed safely
Borrow Checker	Prevents data races at compile-time
Lifetimes	Ensures references live long enough
Zero-cost Abstractions	No runtime cost for high-level features

✅ Why Rust's Architecture is Powerful
🚫 No garbage collector → deterministic performance

🧠 Compiler handles safety (nulls, threads, memory)

🛡️ Concurrency without fear of data races

🧰 Modern tools with Cargo, Clippy (linter), Rustfmt (formatter)
